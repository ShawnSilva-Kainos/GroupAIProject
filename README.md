# GroupAIProject

A collaborative AI project worked on by Shawn Silva and Josh Grefte

The aim of this project is to determine the best model to predict the width of a petal 

We will be using the Iris database 

The models we used were :
      - Linear Regression
      - Random forest
      - Artificial Neural Networks
